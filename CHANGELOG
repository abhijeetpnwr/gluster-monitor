Change Log

Investigate
- add help screen overlay to show the commands (greg Olsen)
- screen resize. When detected, the dh and vh settings could be recalculated to resize the areas in the UI?
- look at pass_persist to expose IOPS to snmp - see http://www.woofpuppy.com/2012/05/exposing-iostat-data-via-snmp-in.html
	- add IOPS to rollup for cluster in info window
	- add total IOPS to each node stats - UCD-DISKIO-MIB
- could add the snmpset for the nicstats to the start up process - check the setting, and warn if necessary - DROPPED
- ip discards total for each node to pick up network errors
- add sysUpTimeInstance to each of the nodes
- change symbols used to be ascii for tty consoles - > up, | down, ? unknown for example DONE
- add colour
- Using a volume status - online, degraded, restricted, offline, stopped
- changing volume gathering for glusterfs commands - status detail and info and merge the contents together 
  instead of using the snmp method. May simplify and reduce the code base.



1.0.0 <-- Current
- fixed batch mode alignment - DONE
- added --bg-mode (-b) to show nodes(default), summary, all and --format (-f) for raw or readable(default)
- Documentation updates to README

0.99-3
- fixed bug highlighted with 3.4 changes to the order of parameters in the volfiles

0.99-2 
- fixes applied to account for changed SNMP behaviour on Fedora 17 and above (host resources MIB doesn't keep the
  hrStorage items in sync across Descr / Size and Used)
- included the older glusterfs 3.2 syntax in the daemon monitoring (-f in 3.2, -s in 3.3!)
- changes to spec file to make rc.local changes optional, and dependency on glusterfs is now 3.2

0.99
- started to split up the code to make it more manageable - gtop_utils, gtop_iputils
- added checks for ctdb, samba, nfs, self heal, georep on every node scan and updated the node display
- changed status icons based on terminal type, xterm has better unicode support so use if available
- added get for hrSystemDate for each node to enable clock skew detection between nodes, with 
  initial logic to compare time across node sample time stamps - shows when ntp drift or daemon 
  is not running


0.98 
- change the volume and data sections from windows to pads to support scrolling so gtop can support large clusters
- change volume area to be scrollable ( up and down keys)
- change node area to be scrollable (+ and - keys)
- updated the symbols used for node up/down and highlighting to account for console (vt) and xterm unicode and 
  colour differences


0.95
- extended the sort capability to the user allowing the on screen data to be sorted as follows;
  . volume info (v, toggles name / f toggles freespace / s toggles size)
  . system data (n nodename / c toggles CPU% . i netin / o netout / r disk reads / w disk writes)
- expanded config file to provide run time overrides (snmp name, screen area ratio's minimums, disk blocksize/sector)
- switched to 64bit network counters (SNMP HC OIDs), and added fix to catch counter rollovers/overflows in nic stats

0.92
- replace the use of python threads with the multiprocssing model to make the calls to snmpwalk non-blocking (async)
- added numretries=0 and timeout (1sec) parms to snmp class as default for every snmpwalk session
- if snmp fails for a host - reset the sys stats to 0 - and continue to try and pool to pick up when host comes back online
- volume information is sorted alphabetically by name for consistent display

0.91
- replace curses A_REVERSE for volume bars with unicode block symbols making code simpler
- add status symbol to represent the state of each node in interactive mode - up,down,unknown


0.9 ../02/2013 - To Do List
- Catching xterm resize exception and terminating gracefully. Python 2.7 has features making this easier to handle DONE
- use the volume list and node list to dynamicaly build the screen window sizes instead of them being hard set - DONE
- Add -g runtime option - DONE
- Add function to read external XML config file to define groups of servers to scan (~/gtoprc.xml)--> DONE
- glusterpeers updated (simplified using join)	--> DONE
- Errors written to stdout now all prefixed ERR for consistency and 'callout' --> DONE
- relayout windows just using full width horizontal areas - cluster / volumes / systems - DONE
- add a rollup of metrics to the info window and relayout to 3 horizontal areas - info > volume > nodes -DONE
	-disk read/write - DONE
	-netin netout - DONE
	- avg/peak CPU - DONE
	- total usable capacity - configured and free - DONE


0.85 ../01/2013
- Changed output logic to make more reuseable
- added curses support, CTRL-C or q/Q is available
- volume and cluster info areas added to the standard host data information
- removed keyscan (Console class/methods) since curses now being used
- added display of core count and server memory to host details
- added support for striped volumes
- added update to the info window for peer status, with warning if active < cluster size


0.81 25/01/2013
- merge getclusterpeers into a cluster class
- added issueCMD function, and updated screenSize to use issueCMD - DONE
- changed references from RHS to gluster - DONE
- creating host objects earlier simplifying code - DONE
- changed get peer list to use gluster cli through issueCMD interface - DONE
- changed thread object to accept a type, to dictate which data function to run - DONE
- added xlator class and volume class and methods...DONE
- added get data code for filesystem utilisation and GLUSTERvol updates - DONE
- switched to using a 1 second pause and timer to manage the data gathering allowing different stats
  to be gathered at different points - DONE 

0.7  ../01/2013
- First internal release for peer review
